## Using this code base

This project is written as a [research compendium](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986). 

To use the functions in this research compendium, you can build and install this research compendium as an R package. Alternatively, you can also use `devtools::load_all()` to bring all of the relevant functions into memory.

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("psmits/notfossil")
```
