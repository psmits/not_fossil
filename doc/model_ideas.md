Poisson regression where response is number of fossils of order occurring in geologic/macrostrat unit. 

Covariates are interesting here. Because the unit of study is number of occurrences per the geologic/macrostrat unit, we can use fossil group information, geological, and environmental information. At the momment, all fossil occurrences have an order, class, and phylum which gives three group levels making for a fun multi-level problem. If their relative relatedness could somehow be included, all the better. For geologic information I have thickness, duration, spatial movement over duration, tropical at start/stop of unit, if unit changes tropical/temperate over duration, (rough) areal extent, and lithological composition (large matrix). I don't have environmental information yet, though that might be coming from Seth's collaborators.

What might be of particular interest for the future, if extremely difficiult to incorporate, is taking into account spatio-temporal structure in the data to better understand how sampling/avaliability is driven where a unit is and when it was "forming."
